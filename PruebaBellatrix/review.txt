Improvements
1. Lack of Documentation
2. Create a Singleton to manage only one Connection if it's necessary
3. Clean of unused variables
4. Repeated date use
5. Return to force end of method
6. Length == 0, it's better to use empty
7. Missing params exception are thrown in the use of the class, not in the construction
8. Unnecesary properties creation
9. Maybe to make easier implementation of initialization, create a class to wrap dbParam (not implemented, it's just an idea)
10. Throw runtime exceptions instead of exceptions to avoid a lot of try/catch blocks in the implementation
11. Creation of the file only when it's necessary
12. Use of Constants and String formats
